# v0.5.2 Release Notes

This patch release restores mixed chart/table patch workflows on COM-backed
execution and clarifies error behavior for non-COM environments.

## Highlights

- Restored mixed-op support:
  - `create_chart` and `apply_table_style` can be executed in one request when
    the backend resolves to COM (`backend="com"` or COM-available
    `backend="auto"`).
- Improved error behavior:
  - when COM is unavailable, mixed `create_chart` + `apply_table_style`
    requests now return a clear COM-required error.
- Added and updated regression coverage:
  - mixed request succeeds on COM
  - mixed request fails clearly when COM is unavailable
  - `backend="openpyxl"` continues to reject `create_chart` requests

## Notes

- This release does not add new MCP tools or patch operations.
- Documentation (README and MCP guide) has been aligned with the restored
  mixed-op behavior.
