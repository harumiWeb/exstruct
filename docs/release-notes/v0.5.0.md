# v0.5.0 Release Notes

This release expands MCP editing from MVP scope to practical workbook design
flows, and adds new MCP tools for workbook creation, op discovery, and runtime
diagnostics.

## Highlights

- Added `exstruct_make` for one-call workbook creation and initial `ops` apply.
  - `out_path` is required, `ops` is optional.
  - Supports `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`, and `.xls` (with COM constraints on `.xls`).
- Expanded `exstruct_patch` design editing operations:
  - `draw_grid_border`, `set_bold`, `set_font_size`, `set_font_color`,
    `set_fill_color`, `set_dimensions`, `auto_fit_columns`, `merge_cells`,
    `unmerge_cells`, `set_alignment`, `set_style`, `apply_table_style`
  - Internal inverse op: `restore_design_snapshot`
- Added MCP operation schema discovery tools:
  - `exstruct_list_ops`
  - `exstruct_describe_op`
- Added MCP runtime diagnostics tool:
  - `exstruct_get_runtime_info`
- Improved patch UX and output controls:
  - Top-level `sheet` fallback for non-`add_sheet` ops (`op.sheet` has higher
    priority when both are present)
  - Artifact mirroring via `mirror_artifact` and server `--artifact-bridge-dir`
  - Backend controls for patch/make: `backend` input and `engine` output

## Notes

- `backend="auto"` now prefers COM when available, with controlled fallback to
  openpyxl for compatible cases.
- `apply_table_style` requested with `backend="com"` falls back to openpyxl
  with a warning.
- MCP docs and README pages were updated to reflect the new make/patch flows
  and operation schema guidance.
