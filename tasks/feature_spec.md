# Feature Spec

## 2026-03-19 v0.7.0 release closeout

### Goal

- Publish the `v0.7.0` release-prep artifacts for the workbook editing work delivered through issue `#99`.
- Collapse temporary issue and review logs after moving the only remaining maintainer-facing rule into permanent documentation.
- Keep a compact closeout record that states where permanent information now lives and how the release-prep work was verified.

### Permanent destinations

- `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Holds the `0.7.0` `Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed` summary for the public release.
- `docs/`
  - `docs/release-notes/v0.7.0.md` records the user-facing release narrative for issue `#99`, review follow-ups, and maintainer-facing documentation work.
  - `mkdocs.yml` keeps the canonical `Release Notes` navigation entry for `v0.7.0`.
- `dev-docs/architecture/overview.md`
  - Records the legacy monkeypatch compatibility precedence note for compatibility shims.
- `dev-docs/specs/`
  - No new spec migration was required for this closeout; the existing editing API and CLI specs remain the canonical contract source.
- `dev-docs/adr/`
  - No new ADR or ADR update was required; existing `ADR-0006` and `ADR-0007` continue to cover the policy boundary.
- `tasks/feature_spec.md` and `tasks/todo.md`
  - Retain only this release-closeout record plus verification, not the historical phase-by-phase work log.

### Constraints

- Public API / CLI / MCP contracts and backend selection policy remain unchanged in this closeout.
- `README.md` and `docs/index.md` do not gain direct release-note links; `mkdocs.yml` stays the canonical route.
- `uv.lock` is not fully regenerated; only the local `exstruct` package version is aligned to `0.7.0`.

### Verification

- `uv run task build-docs`
- `uv run task precommit-run`
- `rg -n "0\.7\.0|v0\.7\.0" pyproject.toml uv.lock CHANGELOG.md mkdocs.yml docs/release-notes/v0.7.0.md`
- `rg -n "^## " tasks/feature_spec.md tasks/todo.md`
- `git diff --check -- CHANGELOG.md docs/release-notes/v0.7.0.md mkdocs.yml pyproject.toml uv.lock tasks/feature_spec.md tasks/todo.md dev-docs/architecture/overview.md`

### ADR verdict

- `not-needed`
- rationale: this was release preparation and task-log retention cleanup. The policy decisions already live in `ADR-0006`, `ADR-0007`, and the editing specs.
